# How does it work

- The [WebAPI](./WebAPI/) folder:

  - An ASP.NET Core web API providing app ratings

  - Uses [StoreLib](https://github.com/StoreDev/StoreLib) to get app rating

  - The API response is consumed by [Shields.IO](https://shields.io) to generate an [endpoint badge](https://shields.io/endpoint)

  - Code on `main` branch will be deployed to [Fly.io](https://fly.io)

- The [WebUI](./WebUI/) folder:

  - A Vue web app to help you generate badges

  - Code on `main` branch will be deployed to GitHub Pages

# Known issues

Due to [StoreLib](https://github.com/StoreDev/StoreLib)'s limitation, generating badges for unpackaged Win32 apps (like [PowerToys](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/XP89DCGQ3K6VLD) and [VSCode](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/XP9KHM4BK9FZ7Q)) is not supported.
